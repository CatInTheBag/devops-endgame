 ## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive DevOps approach for a Spring Boot application using Java 17, Maven, Git, GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS. It encompasses CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure provisioning, and deployment automation.

## Project Purpose:

To develop a fully automated DevOps pipeline for a Spring Boot application, ensuring consistent quality, reliable deployments, and efficient infrastructure management.

## Target Audience:

Development teams seeking to implement streamlined DevOps practices for Java applications on AWS.

## Key Features:

  1. CI/CD Pipeline: Employs GitHub Actions to automate testing, linting, security checks, and building a Docker image.

  1. Infrastructure Provisioning: Utilizes Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure resources - in our case ec2 instance.

  1. Deployment Automation: Automatically deploys the Docker image to AWS using a custom runner running on aws ec2 instance. 

## Prerequisites:

  1. Java 17: Install Java 17 to run the Spring Boot application.
  2. Maven: Install Maven to build the application and its dependencies.
